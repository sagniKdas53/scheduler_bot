# Scheduler Bot

## Basically the bot implementation of my other project that harvests data

### This is what it does once it's started

the &&upadte is supposed to be done automatically but I haven't done it yet.

Please contact me on discord at purevert#7779 if you want to, it will be nice to see if someone actually used this.
I made this is as a hobby project to learn more about bots and python.
